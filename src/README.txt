This model can be compiled in two ways:
a) runhydro_so.f90 is to act as a .dll interface for the model to be
linked to R
b) runhydro.f90 builds a stand-alone executable

note runhydro.f90, UNIXcompile.sh and this README.txt files should be
temporarily removed from the tophspf code folder when the .dll compilation is conducted
